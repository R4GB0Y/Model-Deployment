# Model Deployment Testing Laboratory

Welcome to the Model Deployment Testing Laboratory. Here, we explore different methods of deploying machine learning models, evaluating their performance, and ensuring scalability. Our key focus areas include:

## 1. FastAPI Deployment
Experience the efficiency of deploying Natural Language Processing (NLP) models with FastAPI. This section includes:
   - **NLP Model Deployment:** Steps to deploy a transformer model using FastAPI.
   - **API Testing Screenshots:** Visual evidence of API functionality, featuring FastAPI and Postman interfaces.

     - ![Postman Test](https://github.com/R4GB0Y/Model-Deployment/blob/main/postman1.PNG?raw=true)

## 2. API Containerization with Docker
Streamline your deployment process with Docker. This section demonstrates:
   - **Docker Container Setup:** Detailed instructions for encapsulating the API in a Docker container.
   - **Deployment Screenshots:** Visual guides to assist in Docker containerization.

## 3. TensorFlow Extended (TFX) for Model Serving
Leverage TensorFlow Extended (TFX) for deploying transformer models. Highlights include:
   - **TFX Model Serving:** Guide to serve models efficiently using TensorFlow Extended.
   - **Deployment Screenshot:** Visual proof of TFX in action.
